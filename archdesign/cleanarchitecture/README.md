# The Clean Architecture
Source: (https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

This an implementation of a User Management API applying clean architecture with NodeJS. This is only experimental.


# User Management System (UMS)

User management, bassically in its simplest form, is a method by which you can create, remove and maintain your user store. Our suite solution and any software designed to serve multiple users must have some type of a user management system, could be it a proprietary tool built into the product or a tie into an existing system such as Active Directory/LDAP, or another identity provider.

User Management System is part of our suite (coming soon we will be releasing details), but not only establishes a userâ€™s authorization to access secure resources, it also serves as a repository of identities and, if done efficiently, can be the source of all identities for an organization.
